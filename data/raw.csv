I have based this on 2 unpublished data sets. One is a 167bp portion of the mt-CO1 barcoding gene. This portion shows 2 fixed differences between both species, with 2 [R.] microptera and 4 [R.] rolland DNA sequences each included. The other is based on the entire mt-cytochrome b gene. This shows 5 fixed differences between both species for 1143bp. For the cytochrome b dataset, I then combined the Rollandia sequences with grebe species of the eared clade ([P.] nigricollis, [P.] gallardoi, [P.] occipitalis) in an alignment and calibrated the node separating Rollandia from eared Podiceps at 5.82MY (as per Ogawa 2015). This yields about 1MY for the divergence between both Rollandia species. The CO1 genes evolves a bit faster, so therefore I have accounted for a lower end of 500KYA. Although this lower end is admittedly not very precise, I suspect that the divergence time in Titicaca is older than that for the situation in Junin, and certainly that in Atitlan. For the CO1 and CYTB genes there is no distinguishable fixed difference between [P.] gigas and [P.] podiceps. We need more data, but I suspect that this latter divergence is quite recent.""",0,0,3,18,0,33.9,1.6,0.9,1.7,9.8,1.1,5,3,0.846,43.751,0.428,19.583,11.1,12.3,7.8,26.03,32.89,36.2,43,0.611,0.579,0.009,0.087,10.5,12,35.71428571,34.24657534,6.154,12.78,0.018,0.444,23.5,31.4,40,45.45454545,14.17,438.662,0.012,0.275,21.6,27.1,50,76.92307692,4.184100418,2.388535032,6.172839506,3.267973856,4.95049505,3.963011889,0.748,66.812,0.437,37.513,5.6,26.1,25.6,20.8,20.5,28.9,40.4,6.13,6.401,0.036,0.468,55.2,16.3,12.72264631,11.23595506,32.337,31.557,0.036,1.584,20.4,23,9.451795841,10.41666667,29.521,39.722,0.02,2.051,28.5,35.5,15.47987616,18.51851852,0.6660746,0.850581231,2.016129032,1.301518438,1.857585139,2.166064982,0.194,14.892,0.089,10.914,4.5,7.5,6.2,20.5,21.4,22.2,30.4,10.193,6.708,0.056,0.455,18.2,13,7.320644217,6.142506143,13.73,16.179,0.025,1.11,36.4,50.1,5.48245614,5.285412262,20.87,20.335,0.02,0.855,36.2,9,7.800312012,8.650519031,0.78905839,0.790305585,1.533742331,1.132930514,1.668520578,1.489572989,0.148,17.453,0.088,9.002,7.3,12.7,11.5,22,22.5,57,31.2,5.535,5.635,0.012,0.359,18.8,12.6,11.0619469,10.96491228,14.221,13.834,0.015,1.62,34.1,11.6,8.064516129,8.503401361,20.876,19.937,0.011,1.64,39,36.4,11.82033097,10.30927835,0.798934754,2.205882353,1.234567901,1.348920863,1.50981379,1.538461538,0.253,8.839,0.132,5.809,8.6,9.6,11,31.8,36.8,40.6,51,6.95,8.05,0.048,0.78,18,NA,7.788161994,0,11.917,12.526,0.04,0.682,40.6,7.6,12.59445844,9.174311927,15.491,15.593,0.038,1.03,17,14.1,11.60092807,7.788161994,1.277139208,1.367989056,0.101351351,0.080213904,1.897533207,1.713306682
